# NarrowDNN

I've noticed that even 1-channel DNN could learn to distinguish 2 classes in some binary classification tasks.

> So what if we aggregate a lot of 1-channel DNNs to deal with multi-classification tasks (e.g. MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)? Let's see.

| Dataset           | Accuracy |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| **MNIST**         | 93%      |
| **Fashion-MNIST** | 80%      |
| **CIFAR-10**      | 38%      |
